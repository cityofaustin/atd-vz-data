This geoJSON file is an intermediate product from loading the engineering areas into
the Vision Zero database. The upstream, and up to date, source of this data is found here:
https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=28c369f7ab534c64a26a646fca3fd6ec.
This file is not intended to be used as a source of the TPW engineering areas, but rather
to show the form of the data when it was loaded.
